This example shows how to generate and fit toy data sets including
background subtracted via sPlots.
It uses standard RooFit PDFs rather than RooHSEventsPDFs which require
simulated data for generation.
It uses the HASPECT script HSSubmitFarm.C for job submition
This requires the following environment variables to be set

 The directory to get local files
 setenv HS_LAUNCH  $PWD
 set the base output directory e.g.
 setenv HS_FILEDIR $PWD/out
 Set an extra directory to put output into e.g.
 setenv HS_OUTDIR Run1
 The fitting script e.g.
 setenv HS_RUNMAC $PWD/GenFitToys.C
 setenv HS_GENMODEL $PWD/CreateGenModel.C
 setenv HS_FITMODEL $PWD/CreateFitModel.C
 setenv HS_FARMRUN $PWD/pbs_genfit

if your farm submit command is not qsub you will also need,
 setenv HS_FARMSUB jsub
Or some other commmand
You will need to edit the HS_FARMRUN script for your own environment
For example you may need to make a directory to run on the farm in.
e.g in pbs_genfit
    mkdir -p /home/dglazier/$HS_OUTDIR/$HS_JOBNAME
    cd /home/dglazier/$HS_OUTDIR/$HS_JOBNAME


To run locally
root 'HSSubmitFarm.C(1,0)'
where 1 can be replace by the number of jobs you would like and 0 =>local, change to 1 to submit to farm
